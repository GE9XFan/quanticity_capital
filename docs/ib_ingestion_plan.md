# Interactive Brokers (IB) Ingestion Plan

We will start IB integration only after the Unusual Whales REST + WebSocket feeds are solid. This document describes the feeds we care about, where their data will live, and what needs to be in place before coding begins.

## 1. Feeds

| Feed | Source | Cadence | Primary Use |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Level 1 top-of-book quotes | TWS API (reqMktData) | Streaming | price snapshots, analytics, signal confirmation |
| Level 2 depth (DOM) | TWS API (reqMktDepth) | Streaming | future market microstructure analytics |
| 5-second bars | TWS API (reqRealTimeBars) | 5s cadence | complement UW price feed, backup for OHLC generation |
| Account + portfolio | TWS API (reqAccountUpdates / reqPositions) | On change + periodic | risk checks, execution sizing |

## 2. Storage Targets

| Data | Redis | Postgres | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| L1 quotes | `ib:l1:<symbol>` hash (latest bid/ask/last) + stream `ib:l1:<symbol>:stream` (short window) | Optional later | same pattern as UW price snapshots |
| L2 depth | `ib:l2:<symbol>` hash for latest aggregated view | Optional (JSON per update) | start simple; detailed history can wait |
| Real-time bars | append to `ib:bars:<symbol>` Redis stream (`maxlen` ~ 300) | Postgres table `ib_real_time_bars` | reuse UW history approach |
| Account/portfolio | `ib:account` hash + `ib:positions:<symbol>` hash | Postgres `ib_positions` snapshot once per run | Enables risk engine to query quickly |

## 3. Runtime Outline

1. Reuse settings model: IB host/port/client ID already present in `.env.example`.
2. Launch a dedicated asyncio loop (similar to WebSocket service) that hosts the IB API client.
3. For each subscription: update Redis hash for latest state and push to stream if we want short-term history.
4. Postgres writes mirror the UW history pattern: append rows for bars and periodic account snapshots.

## 4. Dependencies & Setup

- Ensure TWS/IB Gateway is running with API access enabled.
- Verify network connectivity from this machine to the TWS host/port.
- Store credentials (client ID, host, port) in `.env`.
- Consider a simple watchdog that restarts the IB connection if it drops.

## 5. Validation Checklist (when we implement)

- Redis: `redis-cli HGETALL ib:l1:SPY`, `redis-cli XREVRANGE ib:bars:SPY + - COUNT 5`.
- Postgres: `SELECT * FROM ib_real_time_bars ORDER BY fetched_at DESC LIMIT 5;`.
- Account: spot-check position values against TWS dashboard.

This plan mirrors the patterns already proven with Unusual Whalesâ€”once UW streams are live on Monday, we can follow this guide to add IB support without surprises.
